# 📁 Basic Web Development Projects

## 👋 Overview
This repository is a personal workspace for exploring and practicing the **core building blocks of web development**. It includes small, focused projects created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while learning how the web functions at a fundamental level.

The projects here are intentionally simple. The priority is understanding concepts clearly and applying them through hands-on work, not building visually complex or production-ready applications.
